							<h2>Project Summary:</h2>
								<p>ABB’s Industrial Automation Power Generation (IAPG) business primarily serves large utility-scale power generation facilities around the world by providing automation and control systems that safely and efficiency operate electrical power plants providing electricity to billions of people on the planet. As we move forward to a cleaner and lower carbon future, IAPG developed a <strong>Renewable Energy Management System (REMS)</strong> designed to manage small-scale “behind the meter” energy assets including photovoltaics, combined heat and power systems, electricity storage, EV charging, and more. The challenge is that they <strong>do not have intimate knowledge of the end users</strong> in this market and therefore do not know how best to design the UI/UX. Our goals were to <strong>understand the University market segment (customer)</strong>, who the end users may be and what their needs are related to renewable energy management.  Given these needs, <strong>design a UI/UX that satisfies 1-2 primary use cases</strong> while providing a user experience for the end user that meets the expectations of someone in this market segment (e.g. university utility plant operations staff).</p>

							<h4>Secondary Research</h4>
							<br>
							<p><u>Goals:</u></p>
							<ol>
								<li>Gain a base understanding of energy management and electricity
								</li>
								<li>Learn common terms and associations when it comes to energy and energy consumption</li>
								<li>Compare other examples of products already on market or soon to be on market</li>
							</ol>	
							<p>Most of our Secondary Research consisted of looking more into energy, energy consumption, and energy management. We came into this project without a very strong understanding in any of these ideas. Therefore, we needed to start off with strong secondary research to get us well acquainted with the field we were working within. We also did lots of competitive analysis throughout our design process in order to compare ABB’s direction to other industry standards.
							</p>
							<p>Our Secondary provided the footing for our group to begin to understand more about this field. With the gained knowledge of industry standards and language we were able to go into our primary research with enough knowledge to be able to speak to experts in the field. Because of this we were able to build a strong repertoire with our users.</p>

									<p><b>Takeaway's from Activity 1:</b></p>
										<ol>
											<li>Reports should be data-driven and they have to be designed in a way to easily identify the economics of it
											</li>
											<li>With the grid - everything has to be integrated and it’s helpful to see data instantaneously and dynamically
											</li>
											<li>A big surprise was that our participant who is highly cost driven, didn’t think about writing “cost” on one of the main sticky notes
											</li>
											<li>Important categories included storage, grid, cost comparison, % renewables, dynamic, report/statistics, emissions, integrative, and energy saving
											</li>
										</ol>		
								</div>
								<div class="col-4">
									<p><b>Takeaway's from Activity 2:</b></p>
										<ol>
											<li>Top down structures are where the user’s mind goes first (helpful to have a general then more specific approach)
											</li>
											<li>Having dropdown menus where the user can go further into a specific data function are helpful</li>
											<li>Too much customization can be bad because it adds unnecessary complexity and is hard to use for multiple levels of users (building managers vs. entire system managers)</li>
											<li>Graph trends are helpful especially when compared with previous year/month data to show easy comparisons</li>
											<li>Executive summaries are the most important thing to see and showcase on the main page for easy interpretation of data</li>
										</ol>	
									</div>
								<div class="col-4">
									<p><b>Takeaway's from Activity 3:</b></p>
										<ol>
											<li>Data you want to know from each source (i.e. wind, solar etc) should be clear and show the current conditions
											</li>
											<li>One participant listed the things she would want to see which include key data, cost per unit of each sources, how much is coming from each source, and demand curve of trend</li>
											<li>She also emphasized the importance of making it simple and clear to read and having a button to see each subsystem</li>
											<li>The other participant put more emphasis on having the data be real-time and automatically updated</li>

							<h4>Whiteboarding</h4>
							<p>In order to kick off the design phase of this project, we looked to our results from our research and co-design in order to inform our design decisions.  We started off by diverging and whiteboarding the layout of the REMS as well as figuring out the content that needed to be included on each page.
							</p>

									</div>
								</div>
							</div>
							<h4>Sketching</h4>
							<p>We then dove into sketching with several 2-3 minute rounds of sketching.  Individually, we started  off with an idea/layout for the REMS, then built upon our sketches with each round.</p>

							<p>At the end, we came together and consolidated the most important parts of our sketches and transitioned into wireframes.</p>

							Wireframing

							<div class="box alt">

									<p>These templates were used as a starting point to create the wireframes you see below. These wireframes repesent different pages within the REMS we redesigned. These pages include site overview, reports, generation, consumption, forecasts and settings.</p>
									<div class="col-6"><h5>Site Overview Page</h5><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Dashboard.svg" alt="" /></span><blockquote> Allows users to view “quick statistics” of information and current conditions that may be important to them regarding their site.

									<div class="col-6"><h5>Reports Page</h5><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Reports 2.svg" alt="" /></span><blockquote>Allows users to create reports for any type of data for any period of time they would like to see</blockquote></div>
									<div class="col-6"><h5>Generation Page</h5><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Generation.svg" alt="" /></span><blockquote>Shows the user visualizations showing the amount of energy the site has generated over time.</blockquote></div>
									<div class="col-6"><h5>Consumption Page</h5><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Consumption.svg" alt="" /></span><blockquote>Consists of 3 visuals showing energy consumption within the user’s site. Allows the user to quickly track how much energy different assets are consuming.</blockquote></div>
									<div class="col-4"><h5>Energy Overview Page</h5><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Solar Overview.svg" alt="" /></span><blockquote>Dives a little bit deeper into the more specific information pertaining to a particular kind of energy source. In this specific case this page of the wireframe dives deeper into the solar energy data. </blockquote></div>
									<div class="col-4"><h5>Forecast Page</h5><span class="image fit"><img src="images/forecasts.svg" alt="" /></span><blockquote>Users can see a range of types of data visualization for upcoming months/years. At the top left, users can select a specific timespan to compare and lookup forecasts and can select how many years forward as well as min, max,or standard deviation. Users can also see a list of broken down reports (bottom left) which list price and amount.</blockquote></div>
									<div class="col-4"><h5>Settings Page</h5><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Settings.svg" alt="" /></span><blockquote>Gives users a customizable portion of what they want to see at the top “quick stats” portion where they can select the KPIs that are most important to them. Users can also choose how they want their data presented (weekly/monthly/or yearly) based on how they want to see the trends.
